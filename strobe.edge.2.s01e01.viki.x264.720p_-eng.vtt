00:06.720 --> 00:07.940
What class and year are you?

00:07.940 --> 00:11.280
I'm a first year, in Class 1. My name is Ninako Kinoshita.

00:11.280 --> 00:18.400
I didn't fall for him, hoping anything would come out of this.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.410
I just want him to know how happy I am to be in love.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.600
Ren, I like you.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.270
I'm sorry. I already have a girlfriend.

00:27.270 --> 00:28.780
Is this your girlfriend?

00:28.780 --> 00:33.250
Ren only looks blunt and cold. He's really kind at heart.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.570
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.840
You don't understand the limits there are
in your relationship with him.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.620
When you have a crush like mine, it'll become obvious.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.540
Then choose me.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.170
I'll prove to you some things won't ever change.

00:48.170 --> 00:51.590
I know there's already someone else in your heart.

00:51.590 --> 00:54.670
I love you, even when you're rejecting me.

00:54.670 --> 00:57.610
Doesn't it bother you that I keep crushing on Ninako?

00:57.610 --> 01:00.200
Let's figure out what works, together.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.760
He's distancing himself to extinguish his feelings for her.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.850
No person is without worry though.

01:06.850 --> 01:08.970
- I love you.
- You're an idiot.

01:08.970 --> 01:11.420
Long time no see, Takumi.

01:11.420 --> 01:15.590
It would only hurt to continue pining for Ren.

01:15.590 --> 01:19.220
But I want to stay in love with him.

01:19.890 --> 01:23.630
There's another reason to like him just a bit more.

01:31.160 --> 01:36.900
[First day as Second Years]

01:52.070 --> 01:53.650
Ninako!

01:55.450 --> 01:57.490
- Morning!
- Morning.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.620
Looks like we're all in the same class again.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.100
- Yup.
- Lucky for you three.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.870
Why am I the only one not in Class 4?

02:05.870 --> 02:07.740
At least you're right next door.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.090
But I wanted to be with you, Sayuri.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.200
Sorry, could I slip past you?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.800
Sure. My bad.

02:14.950 --> 02:17.890
I swear someone's trying to tear us apart.

02:17.890 --> 02:21.080
You're imagining things. And that's not happening, okay?

02:21.080 --> 02:22.740
I see Ren's in our class, too.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.180
He is!

02:26.190 --> 02:28.140
I feel like I'm dreaming.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.120
I'm in the same class as my crush.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.850
I won't have to rely on coincidences to see him anymore.

02:35.850 --> 02:40.520
I'll get to see him everyday, in this very classroom.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.440
Stare at him like that, and he'll realize you still like him.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.440
Thanks for the warning.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.290
Ninako, you're working today, right?

02:50.290 --> 02:52.800
Let's head over together after school.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.180
Sure.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.760
You're in a good mood.

03:04.760 --> 03:09.850
Why wouldn't I be? We're in the same class,
and I'm getting alone time with you now.

03:15.060 --> 03:18.360
[Mao Sugimoto]

03:18.800 --> 03:20.290
Seriously?

03:21.330 --> 03:23.890
I enrolled here because of you.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.040
No you didn't.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.650
What's with that face?

03:34.650 --> 03:38.620
You really think I'll fall for that again?

03:38.620 --> 03:40.660
Screw off.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.650
Come on, Ninako.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.090
Right.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.110
[Episode 1]

04:43.110 --> 04:45.150
Want to work at the cafe again?

04:45.860 --> 04:48.380
I can put in a word for you with Kyo.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.760
It's fine.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.000
Still bummed out over your girlfriend?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.290
- If you have any regrets, go back to her.
- I don't.

04:59.010 --> 05:02.130
I'm not exactly "bummed out" either.

05:03.550 --> 05:04.980
It's just...

05:06.030 --> 05:10.580
Just, what? Don't force down your feelings anymore.

05:14.100 --> 05:18.500
I'm a bit disappointed in myself.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.450
When I realized I had someone else on my mind,

05:23.450 --> 05:27.600
I assumed I should make an effort to forget. And yet...

05:27.600 --> 05:31.990
Ren, I know there's already someone else in your heart.

05:34.450 --> 05:37.060
Don't force yourself to forget and move on.

05:40.310 --> 05:44.210
I still don't understand the difference
between "making an effort" and "forcing myself".

05:50.980 --> 05:53.380
Were your efforts in forgetting her a success?

05:56.580 --> 06:01.850
Trying to forget despite your efforts is called forcing yourself.

06:04.350 --> 06:07.390
Okay, I understand you're disappointed in yourself.

06:07.390 --> 06:11.210
But aren't you wasting time worrying about it
any more than you need to?

06:11.840 --> 06:13.650
I mean, you're in the same class as her now.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.780
Let Ren figure this out at his own pace, alright?

06:16.780 --> 06:21.300
Besides, this ultimately hinges on Kinoshita's feelings as well.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.400
Fair point.

06:31.910 --> 06:36.210
Sorry about my attitude earlier. Did I scare you?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.140
No.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.010
Who was that girl?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.190
My ex-girlfriend from middle school.

06:52.190 --> 06:56.610
The one who used me to get closer to her real crush.

06:57.860 --> 07:02.360
Didn't think I'd lose my cool like that, though. How lame.

07:05.110 --> 07:08.210
You must have really cherished her.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.610
You got worked up, because you cared.

07:18.090 --> 07:21.040
I don't think that's lame.

07:27.830 --> 07:34.270
The guy my ex liked... I actually clicked with him quite a bit.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.860
I thought of him as my best friend.

07:39.270 --> 07:41.630
But one day, I saw them together.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.780
They were sharing a kiss.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.480
My girlfriend's the one who initiated it.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.950
So it really wasn't my friend's fault.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.160
Still... I don't know.

08:00.670 --> 08:03.790
He just seriously pissed me off, for some reason.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.670
I ended up distancing myself from him.

08:14.040 --> 08:17.200
I let go of both of them.

08:18.170 --> 08:22.770
Well, that dude and I aren't necessarily on bad terms though.

08:24.380 --> 08:30.740
We're just never going back to being best buds, I suppose.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.190
What a difficult situation.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.170
Don't look so distressed. I'll hug you.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.660
Wow, do I really warrant such a reaction?

08:58.260 --> 09:00.760
Ouch.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.220
There's no benefit in hanging around me anymore.

09:35.220 --> 09:39.040
Why not make your move with confidence instead?

09:43.140 --> 09:47.680
I told you, I'm not falling for that again.

09:50.630 --> 09:53.470
Too bad.

09:59.210 --> 10:01.550
Long time no see, Ichinose.

10:01.550 --> 10:04.360
I look forward to seeing you around campus.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.720
She apparently came chasing you.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.020
Watch your back, yeah?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.250
Hey look, it's Ninako.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.150
- Busted?
- Yeah.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.080
Aw man...

10:23.760 --> 10:30.210
Don't tell me you still think Ninako has a thing for you.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.620
I'm not that full of myself.

10:34.430 --> 10:39.020
Then let me ask you this. Do you want her to like you again?

10:42.250 --> 10:44.680
And if so, are you gonna do anything to make it happen?

10:46.020 --> 10:50.810
Does the possibility of Ninako liking another guy not bother you?

10:51.390 --> 10:53.340
So what if she likes another guy?

10:54.040 --> 10:56.160
You're only thinking of yourself.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.390
Yeah? Well, if I sway her affections in my favor,

11:00.390 --> 11:04.210
then that's no longer an issue, right?

11:19.850 --> 11:21.850
- Ren got the ball.
- What?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.950
He did it again.
[Spring, 2 Years Ago]

11:58.950 --> 12:01.120
- Seriously?
- Yikes.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.160
He thinks he can get away with anything, with that face of his.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.060
Nice to meet you, new classmate.

12:14.060 --> 12:17.810
I hear you steal people's girlfriends or something?

12:17.810 --> 12:19.710
Let them say what they want.

12:22.110 --> 12:25.960
And don't talk to me, you'll get roped into it.

12:26.890 --> 12:31.310
Yeah? Well, too bad, 'cause I talk to whoever I want.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.390
It's Mao.

12:47.090 --> 12:49.480
GIve me a second.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.400
Come on, we'll be late.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.850
Why don't you go out with anyone, Ren?

13:19.850 --> 13:21.980
Because I already have a girlfriend.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.880
What? Since when?

13:23.880 --> 13:26.510
Since... just the other day, I think.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.390
Who?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.040
She's not from our school.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.130
Then what middle school does she go to?

13:32.130 --> 13:34.890
- She's a high schooler.
- Say what?

13:45.870 --> 13:47.390
Ando.

13:47.390 --> 13:48.770
Yeah?

13:49.400 --> 13:55.240
You're always hanging out with Ichinose, right?

14:00.100 --> 14:06.950
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?

14:11.260 --> 14:12.990
He does.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.440
I see.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.850
Sorry to bother you.

14:34.860 --> 14:36.750
I like you.

14:42.140 --> 14:46.320
Here. A present to commemorate our one month anniversary.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.090
Thanks!

14:49.050 --> 14:52.950
Mao. Do you like me?

14:52.950 --> 14:54.940
You're asking me again?

14:56.920 --> 14:58.670
Of course I like you.

16:14.510 --> 16:16.500
- Mao.
- Yeah?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.510
Do you like me?

16:19.840 --> 16:21.530
Of course I like you.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.880
Well, I hate you.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.460
He did it again.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.200
- Seriously?
- Yikes.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.350
I guess that's Ichinose for you.

16:51.350 --> 16:54.240
- What a disaster.
- It's straight terrifying, man.

17:00.690 --> 17:05.020
It's not your fault I broke up with Mao, okay?

17:13.250 --> 17:15.460
Ando...

17:15.460 --> 17:18.970
We're still best buds, you hear me?

17:18.970 --> 17:22.110
We won't let a little girl trouble ruin our friendship.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.000
Can't believe I'm waking up to a guy.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.980
My bad.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.540
Just get back to class already.

17:59.540 --> 18:04.080
Class ended hours ago. I didn't feel like heading back either.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.800
What, you feel bad for me?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.660
I don't need your pity.

18:10.600 --> 18:16.110
We're not even best friends or anything.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.640
Not anymore.

18:22.890 --> 18:28.850
Why do you always shut up and let things pass? It pisses me off.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.020
We've been through this already.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.200
When Mao kissed you.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.450
Why didn't you ever say anything about it?

18:40.870 --> 18:44.220
You could have at least tried to make an excuse.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.040
What was I supposed to say?

18:49.850 --> 18:54.300
What did you want me to say?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.700
In any case, you still would've...

19:08.390 --> 19:09.960
Whatever.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.750
Stupid Ando.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.450
Takes one to know one, Stupid!

19:19.010 --> 19:21.300
Did Ando wake up?

19:21.300 --> 19:23.030
Yes.

19:23.030 --> 19:24.600
You doing alright?

19:25.690 --> 19:27.010
Yes.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.190
"You should speak up when you're not feeling well."

19:33.020 --> 19:35.290
Remember?

19:40.690 --> 19:42.230
How're you feeling?

19:45.820 --> 19:48.200
I hate feeling like this.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.640
Just let me disappear.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.150
Ren.

20:13.150 --> 20:14.800
Kinoshita.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.260
How was Ando?

20:17.260 --> 20:19.150
He was just feeling a bit dizzy.

20:19.150 --> 20:22.030
He should be fine after a bit of rest.

20:22.030 --> 20:23.770
That's good to hear.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.210
Say...

20:35.730 --> 20:37.250
Yeah?

20:39.100 --> 20:44.620
Can't friends be friends, even if the feeling's not mutual?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.580
Sorry, weird question.

20:54.910 --> 20:59.210
Did you get into an argument with a friend?

21:01.600 --> 21:05.540
I always knew our relationship had gotten rocky.

21:05.540 --> 21:11.450
So I just assumed I wasn't allowed to call him a friend anymore.

21:16.130 --> 21:19.100
Sorry, it's a bit complicated.

21:20.970 --> 21:25.040
But I feel better now after talking it out.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.390
Thanks for lending me an ear.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.390
Sure.

21:34.820 --> 21:39.530
Ren only tells well-meaning white lies.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.590
I couldn't give him any advice.

22:02.150 --> 22:05.480
I promise I feel better, really.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.240
See you around.

22:19.970 --> 22:21.670
Excuse me.

22:23.860 --> 22:27.620
I believe you were with Takumi yesterday?

22:27.620 --> 22:29.330
I was, yes.

22:29.330 --> 22:33.010
Are you Takumi's girlfriend?

22:33.550 --> 22:35.580
No.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.210
Then...

22:40.890 --> 22:43.990
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

22:44.970 --> 22:46.360
What?

23:05.900 --> 23:09.390
Ren and I are only friends.

23:09.390 --> 23:11.980
We'll be splitting up into groups for the school trip.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.250
I regret breaking up with you, Uehara.

23:14.250 --> 23:18.270
Sincerity is guaranteed to be a straight shot to the heart.

23:18.270 --> 23:21.090
I'm confessing to Kinoshita after Sports Day.

23:21.090 --> 23:23.640
- What?
- Just admiring you, Futaba.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.990
I know I won't be able to hold these feelings back forever.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.200
Even though I'm right at his side,

23:30.200 --> 23:35.320
I'm the closest, yet furthest I've been from him.

23:35.320 --> 23:39.090
[Epilogue]

23:45.230 --> 23:47.860
Excuse me, have you seen Takumi?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.200
He was headed your way.

23:52.270 --> 23:55.090
Maybe you two missed each other?

23:55.090 --> 23:58.410
Seems like it.

23:58.410 --> 24:02.060
Just wait, he'll come sprinting back for you.
