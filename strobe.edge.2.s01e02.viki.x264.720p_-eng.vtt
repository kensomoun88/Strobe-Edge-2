00:06.820 --> 00:09.460
Stare at him like that, and he'll realize you still like him.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.780
When I realized I had someone else on my mind,

00:12.780 --> 00:15.940
I assumed I should make an effort to forget.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.750
Were your efforts in forgetting her a success?

00:17.750 --> 00:20.300
- Seriously?
- I enrolled here because of you.

00:20.300 --> 00:24.240
The guy my ex liked... I thought of him as my best friend.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.260
But one day, I saw them together.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.330
You could have at least tried to make an excuse.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.320
What was I supposed to say?

00:30.320 --> 00:32.760
"You should speak up when you're not feeling well."

00:32.760 --> 00:34.280
Ring a bell?

00:34.280 --> 00:37.310
I just assumed I wasn't allowed to call him a friend anymore.

00:37.310 --> 00:41.240
I promise I feel better, really.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.530
Are you Takumi's girlfriend?

00:44.530 --> 00:46.450
No.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.030
Then...

00:51.780 --> 00:54.840
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

00:55.860 --> 00:57.200
What?

01:00.240 --> 01:04.250
You two were lost in each other's eyes.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.410
No, we weren't.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.530
What makes you say that?

01:10.530 --> 01:14.110
Ninako. You'll be late for your shift.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.320
Ando.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.350
I'll catch up with you at the cafe. You go ahead first.

01:18.350 --> 01:19.460
You should take time off today.

01:19.460 --> 01:22.590
I'll be fine. Just tell the manager I'll be running late, okay?

01:22.590 --> 01:24.970
I need to tell this girl something.

01:26.510 --> 01:30.300
I promise it's nothing big. I only want to talk.

01:31.580 --> 01:34.640
Okay, see you later.

01:48.610 --> 01:53.860
I don't know what you're scheming,
but mess with her anymore, and I won't forgive you.

01:57.540 --> 02:01.790
Do you have a crush on her?

02:01.790 --> 02:03.490
So what if I do?

02:05.810 --> 02:10.360
But she probably likes Ichinose.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.850
That's none of your business.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.490
Right?

02:24.650 --> 02:27.050
Your Margarita, and Pesto pizzas.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.940
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.540
- Enjoy.
- Time to dig in.

[Kou Tanaka]

02:47.550 --> 02:49.260
What?

02:49.260 --> 02:53.020
Nothing. I was just admiring you.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.060
What's up with that?

02:55.060 --> 02:56.320
I'll share if you're still hungry.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.860
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.860

Ritsuko.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.630
Will you go out with me?

03:07.630 --> 03:11.960
I prefer older men who are tall, rich, and handsome.

03:11.960 --> 03:16.400
You tick off none of those boxes, so no. It's not happening.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.400
Manabu, Kashiwagi, feel free to take your break.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.560
I'll cook up dinner for us again.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.070
What're you in the mood for?

03:26.120 --> 03:27.710
Carbonara.

03:27.710 --> 03:31.060
One carbonara made with love, coming right up!

03:40.710 --> 03:44.970
This cafe sure is full of one-sided crushes.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.800
Is something wrong?

03:54.330 --> 03:56.600
Did that girl say something to you?

03:57.380 --> 03:58.980
No.

04:05.050 --> 04:10.570
Ren said he fought with an important friend of his.

04:11.950 --> 04:16.790
I couldn't give him any advice,
even though he was feeling so down.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.280
Are you sure about that last part?

04:21.280 --> 04:24.150
That guy's always a downer.

04:24.150 --> 04:26.960
But I've never seen Ren like that before.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.450
What're you doing?

04:52.910 --> 04:54.980
Heading to school.

05:03.180 --> 05:05.850
We're not best friends anymore.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.030
Stuff happened between us in the past.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.690
If anything, it's way more chaotic now.

05:12.690 --> 05:15.040
We're never going back to the way things were
in middle school.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.230
Still...

05:22.170 --> 05:24.310
That doesn't mean we're not friends, alright?

05:25.630 --> 05:28.970
Yesterday, I was just blowing off some steam.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.640
Sorry for the dramatics.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.090
If I'm being honest, you seriously piss me off.

05:41.090 --> 05:47.600
But I'm too prideful to let some girl trouble
ruin our friendship. So be grateful.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.080
That's some weird sense of pride you've got.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.390

- Morning.
- Morning.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.410
- Ando.
- What's up?

06:43.860 --> 06:47.190
Did you come here with Ando? That's an unusual combo.

06:48.150 --> 06:50.420
Yeah. He was waiting for me by the walkway.

06:50.420 --> 06:51.890
Why?

06:51.890 --> 06:53.350
Beats me.

06:53.350 --> 06:55.240
You don't know?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.420
Nope. That guy's just an idiot.

06:59.090 --> 07:03.670
Huh? He seems different today.

07:03.670 --> 07:07.600
Did you end up making up with your friend?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.990
I wonder.

07:13.590 --> 07:17.020
I bet things ended well between them.

07:18.170 --> 07:21.050
- Morning, Ninako.
- Morning.

07:21.050 --> 07:23.880
Do you have a part-time shift today?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.590
No.

07:25.590 --> 07:28.360
Wanna go sing our hearts out at karaoke after school?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.200
Heck yes!

07:30.200 --> 07:33.150
But don't you usually walk home with Daiki?

07:33.150 --> 07:36.470
Daiki lost a bet, and is on the library committee now.

07:36.470 --> 07:38.830
He has to stay back today to organize some books.

07:40.220 --> 07:44.800
Korenaga, where does this book go?

07:45.440 --> 07:50.680
This book... goes on the upper shelf. Here, I'll handle it.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.400
Upperclassmen sure are reliable at times like this.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.900
Yeah?

07:58.160 --> 08:00.240
Thank you.

08:02.140 --> 08:08.650
Say, is it true you were classmates with Ninako last year,
and in middle school?

08:08.650 --> 08:13.000
- That's right. You know Ninako?
- I do.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.830
Isn't she just the cutest?

08:15.830 --> 08:18.090
I sort of admire her.

08:19.390 --> 08:22.230
Really makes me wonder
why she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.950
That's probably because she has a crush on someone.

08:26.610 --> 08:31.140
Would that someone be Ichinose, perhaps?

08:33.800 --> 08:36.940
Ninako is like an open book, isn't she?

08:39.580 --> 08:42.650
I wonder why she fell for him in the first place.

08:42.650 --> 08:47.170
All I know is that they began talking last year,

08:47.170 --> 08:51.670
when Ichinose bought her a keychain
to replace the one he broke.

- Guess I'll stick with Yutaro -

10:29.500 --> 10:32.450
I don't want to be in a group with a downer like him.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.660

Of course not.

Saying that now won't change anything, you know?
Especially because I have a boyfriend.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.080
I know.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.850
Then do your best to forget and move on, okay?

18:49.870 --> 18:53.820
I'll certainly make an effort to act normal.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.710
Are you cold?

19:05.710 --> 19:07.140
No.

19:14.800 --> 19:19.610
I shouldn't have taken your hoodie.
Let's see if I have anything...

19:19.610 --> 19:22.990
I'm not cold at all. I promise.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.670
Really?

19:24.670 --> 19:26.250
Really.

19:28.250 --> 19:33.950
Fine. But if you ever feel cold, I'll warm you right back up.

19:33.950 --> 19:36.010
So come at me.

19:40.210 --> 19:43.160
Okay. Sure.

19:51.220 --> 19:52.980
Pause.

19:55.590 --> 19:59.670
I... I was only joking.

20:02.710 --> 20:06.420
I didn't realize you make jokes like that.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.360
You definitely got me.

20:13.120 --> 20:17.630
I know it wasn't funny.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.080
I slipped up, big time.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.200
I'm so embarrassed.

20:44.290 --> 20:48.010
The only reason Ren is able to joke like that...

20:52.520 --> 20:55.450
The only reason he laughs when our eyes meet...

20:56.110 --> 20:58.010
is because he's at ease with me.

21:00.330 --> 21:07.010
Because he thinks
I don't want to be anything more than friends.

21:08.980 --> 21:13.670
Ren and I are only friends.

21:15.280 --> 21:20.750
We can remain this close
because we're friends, and nothing more.

21:24.390 --> 21:26.780
Even though I'm right at his side...

21:31.540 --> 21:33.870
I'm the closest...

21:36.290 --> 21:40.530
yet furthest I've been from him.

21:46.060 --> 21:49.340
Ninako!

21:49.340 --> 21:51.210
I told you not to get lost!

21:51.210 --> 21:52.850
- Sorry.
- I'm glad he found you.

21:52.850 --> 21:56.730
- I didn't even realize I'd gotten lost.
- Really? I'm so glad.

21:56.730 --> 21:59.060
Look, it's Gacchan.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.800
Yo.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.300
See you guys later.

22:04.300 --> 22:08.100
It's getting late. How about we all go sightseeing, together?

22:08.100 --> 22:12.020
I think... it'd be difficult to hang out as one big group.

22:12.020 --> 22:15.960
Getting chummy with classmates is equally as important.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.440
I mean...

22:19.440 --> 22:22.450
Sure, why not? Let's all go around together.

22:23.230 --> 22:25.490
If you say so.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.890
Come on, let's all take a big group selfie together.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.900
How considerate of you.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.990
Or is that just your composure speaking?

22:38.850 --> 22:42.250
Do I look composed to you?

22:45.490 --> 22:50.440
Whatever. You just keep on
being friends with her, Mr. Considerate.

22:54.510 --> 22:55.750
Ready?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.440
- Can I squeeze in?
- Sure.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.350
- Is that Ren's hoodie?
- Move right a little.

23:01.350 --> 23:02.720
Yeah.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.610
- Or maybe left.
- I see.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.590
Which way should I stand?

23:06.590 --> 23:08.100
Takumi, make a funny face for us.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.700
That's not in my repertoire.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.470
What? I wanna see.

23:37.730 --> 23:41.290
I wonder where your keychain from Ren went.

23:41.290 --> 23:43.480
Me too.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.750
Why not ask him for a new one?

23:45.750 --> 23:48.690
That's definitely a bit much.

23:50.010 --> 23:52.610
Especially if we're just friends.

23:53.780 --> 23:56.590
And are you okay being "just friends" forever?

24:01.830 --> 24:05.740
This is awesome.

24:05.740 --> 24:07.480
Aw, how cute!

24:10.170 --> 24:12.300
I'll get this as a souvenir for Ritsuko.

24:12.300 --> 24:15.000
If it's for a girl, get her something else.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.680
- Why?
- Seriously?

24:16.680 --> 24:18.400
Just go for it.

24:18.400 --> 24:25.410
A person will always appreciate someone
going out of their way for them.

24:25.410 --> 24:26.970
Such wise words, Ren.

24:26.970 --> 24:28.770
Then I'm getting this.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.390
I sure hope she'll appreciate it...

24:32.960 --> 24:34.820
You're not getting anything yourself?

24:35.870 --> 24:38.950
No, I don't think now's the time.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.920
Ninako! Sorry I'm late.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.150
Let's go.

25:20.150 --> 25:21.380
Come on.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.630
See you, Director.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.260
What should I do now?

25:39.780 --> 25:42.940
I don't think I'll be able to hold back these feelings forever.

25:42.940 --> 25:45.610
- I have a crush on Kinoshita.
- What?

25:45.610 --> 25:48.070
Give this back to Ninako. I bet she'd appreciate it.

25:48.070 --> 25:50.150
- Don't say that.
- When else would I tell you?

25:50.150 --> 25:54.570
I want to be Ren's girlfriend.

25:54.570 --> 25:58.240
[Epilogue]

26:00.800 --> 26:02.930
Thanks for lending me your hoodie.

26:03.650 --> 26:05.010
Sure.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.870
I told Yutaro we'd be waiting for them here.

26:08.870 --> 26:10.460
Really? Thanks.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.440
It's Enoshima!

26:29.020 --> 26:31.770
I'd love to go there one day.

26:35.730 --> 26:38.250
Let's go the next time we're here.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.970
I meant we could go as the whole group.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.400
Right.
